abstract = "Development of NTD Ge sensors has been initiated for low temperature (mK) thermometry in The India-based TIN detector (TIN.TIN). NTD Ge sensors are prepared by thermal neutron irradiation of device grade Ge samples at Dhruva reactor, BARC, Mumbai. Detailed measurements have been carried out in irradiated samples for estimating the carrier concentration and fast neutron induced defects. The Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) measurements indicated monovacancy type defects for all irradiated samples, while Channeling studies employing RBS with 2MeV alpha particles, revealed no significant defects in the samples exposed to fast neutron fluence of ∼4×1016/cm2. Both PALS and Channeling studies have shown that vacuum annealing at 600°C for ∼2h is sufficient to recover the damage in the irradiated samples, thereby making them suitable for the sensor development."
